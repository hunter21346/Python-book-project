Dear Mr.Santino

This email is to apologize to you for the incident I made at the restaurant.
I could not hold my temper and I deeply regret not being able to do so.
I understand that this kind of attitude is absolutely bad and now it is on me to apologize.
I regret my misbehavior. I really do. If you could consider my apology and allow me to resume my job,
I promise not to repeat the same behavior again. 

I hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely,
Tony Stonks
